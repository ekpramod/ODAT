# ODAT
Object Detection and Tracking
Install Python in your computer or Anaconda as I did
download the files to directory of your choice say d:/ODAT
Open Anaconda command prompt
Create a virtual environment using command py -m venv d:/ODAT
Swicth to d:/ODAT/Scripts and type Activate to activate the virtual environment
Install packages using py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
From D:/ODAT, try running using command streamlit run main.py and you should see the browser launched and the UI up and running. Test the model using some images that have cars and buses and pedestrians. Use BDD100K Images
